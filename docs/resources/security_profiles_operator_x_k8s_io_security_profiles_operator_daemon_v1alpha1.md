# k8s_security_profiles_operator_x_k8s_io_security_profiles_operator_daemon_v1alpha1 (Resource)

SecurityProfilesOperatorDaemon is the Schema to configure the spod deployment.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "k8s_security_profiles_operator_x_k8s_io_security_profiles_operator_daemon_v1alpha1" "minimal" {
  metadata = {
    name = "test"
  }
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `metadata` (Attributes) Data that helps uniquely identify this object. See https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#metadata for more details. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--metadata))

### Optional

- `spec` (Attributes) SPODStatus defines the desired state of SPOD. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec))

### Read-Only

- `api_version` (String) APIVersion defines the versioned schema of this representation of an object. Servers should convert recognized schemas to the latest internal value, and may reject unrecognized values. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#resources
- `id` (Number) The timestamp of the last change to this resource.
- `kind` (String) Kind is a string value representing the REST resource this object represents. Servers may infer this from the endpoint the client submits requests to. Cannot be updated. In CamelCase. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#types-kinds
- `yaml` (String) The generated manifest in YAML format.

### Nested Schema for `metadata`

Required:

- `name` (String) Unique identifier for this object. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/names/#names for more details.

Optional:

- `annotations` (Map of String) Keys and values that can be used by external tooling to store and retrieve arbitrary metadata about this object. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/annotations/ for more details.
- `labels` (Map of String) Keys and values that can be used to organize and categorize objects. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/labels/ for more details.
- `namespace` (String) Namespaces provides a mechanism for isolating groups of resources within a single cluster. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/namespaces/ for more details.


<a id="nestedatt--spec"></a>
### Nested Schema for `spec`

Optional:

- `allowed_seccomp_actions` (List of String) AllowedSeccompActions if specified, a list of allowed seccomp actions.
- `allowed_syscalls` (List of String) AllowedSyscalls if specified, a list of system calls which are allowed in seccomp profiles.
- `enable_app_armor` (Boolean) tells the operator whether or not to enable AppArmor support for this SPOD instance.
- `enable_bpf_recorder` (Boolean) tells the operator whether or not to enable bpf recorder support for this SPOD instance.
- `enable_log_enricher` (Boolean) tells the operator whether or not to enable log enrichment support for this SPOD instance.
- `enable_profiling` (Boolean) EnableProfiling tells the operator whether or not to enable profiling support for this SPOD instance.
- `enable_selinux` (Boolean) tells the operator whether or not to enable SELinux support for this SPOD instance.
- `host_proc_volume_path` (String) HostProcVolumePath is the path for specifying a custom host /proc volume, which is required for the log-enricher as well as bpf-recorder to retrieve the container ID for a process ID. This can be helpful for nested environments, for example when using 'kind'.
- `selinux_options` (Attributes) Defines options specific to the SELinux functionality of the SecurityProfilesOperator (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--selinux_options))
- `selinux_type_tag` (String) If specified, the SELinux type tag applied to the security context of SPOD.
- `static_webhook_config` (Boolean) StaticWebhookConfig indicates whether the webhook configuration and its related resources are statically deployed. In this case, the operator will not create or update the webhook configuration and its related resources.
- `tolerations` (Attributes List) If specified, the SPOD's tolerations. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--tolerations))
- `verbosity` (Number) Verbosity specifies the logging verbosity of the daemon.
- `webhook_options` (Attributes List) WebhookOpts set custom namespace selectors and failure mode for SPO's webhooks (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--webhook_options))

<a id="nestedatt--spec--selinux_options"></a>
### Nested Schema for `spec.selinux_options`

Optional:

- `allowed_system_profiles` (List of String) Lists the profiles coming from the system itself that are allowed to be inherited by workloads. Use this with care, as this might provide a lot of permissions depending on the policy.


<a id="nestedatt--spec--tolerations"></a>
### Nested Schema for `spec.tolerations`

Optional:

- `effect` (String) Effect indicates the taint effect to match. Empty means match all taint effects. When specified, allowed values are NoSchedule, PreferNoSchedule and NoExecute.
- `key` (String) Key is the taint key that the toleration applies to. Empty means match all taint keys. If the key is empty, operator must be Exists; this combination means to match all values and all keys.
- `operator` (String) Operator represents a key's relationship to the value. Valid operators are Exists and Equal. Defaults to Equal. Exists is equivalent to wildcard for value, so that a pod can tolerate all taints of a particular category.
- `toleration_seconds` (Number) TolerationSeconds represents the period of time the toleration (which must be of effect NoExecute, otherwise this field is ignored) tolerates the taint. By default, it is not set, which means tolerate the taint forever (do not evict). Zero and negative values will be treated as 0 (evict immediately) by the system.
- `value` (String) Value is the taint value the toleration matches to. If the operator is Exists, the value should be empty, otherwise just a regular string.


<a id="nestedatt--spec--webhook_options"></a>
### Nested Schema for `spec.webhook_options`

Optional:

- `failure_policy` (String) FailurePolicy sets the webhook failure policy
- `name` (String) Name specifies which webhook do we configure
- `namespace_selector` (Attributes) NamespaceSelector sets webhook's namespace selector (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--webhook_options--namespace_selector))

<a id="nestedatt--spec--webhook_options--namespace_selector"></a>
### Nested Schema for `spec.webhook_options.namespace_selector`

Optional:

- `match_expressions` (Attributes List) matchExpressions is a list of label selector requirements. The requirements are ANDed. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--webhook_options--namespace_selector--match_expressions))
- `match_labels` (Map of String) matchLabels is a map of {key,value} pairs. A single {key,value} in the matchLabels map is equivalent to an element of matchExpressions, whose key field is 'key', the operator is 'In', and the values array contains only 'value'. The requirements are ANDed.

<a id="nestedatt--spec--webhook_options--namespace_selector--match_expressions"></a>
### Nested Schema for `spec.webhook_options.namespace_selector.match_labels`

Required:

- `key` (String) key is the label key that the selector applies to.
- `operator` (String) operator represents a key's relationship to a set of values. Valid operators are In, NotIn, Exists and DoesNotExist.

Optional:

- `values` (List of String) values is an array of string values. If the operator is In or NotIn, the values array must be non-empty. If the operator is Exists or DoesNotExist, the values array must be empty. This array is replaced during a strategic merge patch.
